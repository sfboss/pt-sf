## Pivotal Tracker to Salesforce Integration
Enclosed you will find a very MVP version of an Apex REST class that will take in the webhook from Pivotal Tracker that they allow with activity updates.

## Whats Inside
As part of this package you will have in the manifest:
- Project and Project Item objects with relevant Pivotal Tracker fields mapped to them
- Apex REST class setup via an Experience Site to work as a Public API (for demonstration purposes only, for Security minded approaches see some of the non-boiler plate MVP similar packages.  This is just to prove a concept and teach about REST interactions with Salesforce.com
- Permission Set and Profile for the Guest User (Apex Class access to guest user = Public API)
